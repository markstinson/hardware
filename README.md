Disclaimer:

It is recommended to use MonochromeVGA inside an shielded container, which can be as simple as a cardboard box lined with aluminium foil, because although unlikely, the VGA signal could interfere with other nearby devices and depending on the laws of your country, it could lead to fines.

In any case, use any hardware posted here at your own risk.
