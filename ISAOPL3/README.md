Internal OPL3 ISA 8 bits

version 1.0

With problems still unidentified. The schematic is based on texelec board Resound v1.1:

Symptoms:

The first start is always correct, it works and you can hear it perfectly, clear FM OPL3 sound ... but after approximately 2 minutes, it stops working. Normally a sleep period without connecting makes it work again, but there have been cases in which it stops working forever... it seems some kind of overload.

The ICs or components do not look hot, and the voltage tracks are not larger than the rest of the signals, this could be an error, however the width of the same should be sufficient for the mA demand of the ICs (I think) .

Another theory is that I do not use electrolytic 10uF capacitors as in the original design, they are 10uF without polarity, but in principle I think that should not affect the operation.

Is the width of the tracks? Is the position of the components? Is it the quality or type of components? Those're the questions.
